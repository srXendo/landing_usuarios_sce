<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested a full-stack MVP web app called 'Social Chess Events' using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The features included user authentication, event CRUD, event filtering, a system for joining events, and a My Events page. The project then went through several iterations, including adding Chess.com/Lichess integration and multiple UI/branding updates.

However, the user made a major pivot, requesting to discard the full-stack application and replace it with a static landing page built with Next.js.

The final requirements for the landing page were:
1.  **Framework:** Next.js, static export.
2.  **Purpose:** Explain the idea of Social Chess Events with attractive text and graphics, including an interactive feature timeline.
3.  **Content Sections:**
    *   Hero section explaining the app concept.
    *   What is Social Chess Events section.
    *   Interactive timeline showcasing future features (Social Network, Event Organization, Gamification).
    *   SCE Points section explaining partnered venues.
    *   A beta user acquisition form.
4.  **Beta Signup Form:**
    *   Capture Name, City, and Email.
    *   Integrate with a specific Google Form: 
5.  **Specific Copywriting Changes:**
    *   Change Inscripción sencilla to Apuntate a partidas presenciales. Sistema estilo Playtomic: apúntate en segundos, gestiona listas de espera y recibe confirmaciones automáticas.
    *   Change Nueva funcionalidad to Innovación.
    *   Update the Red Social de Ajedrez card copy to be more focused on in-person games.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish (es)

**what currently exists?**
The project is a static landing page built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for animations. The page effectively explains the Social Chess Events concept through several descriptive sections and a feature timeline. It includes a beta signup form that successfully submits data directly to a user-provided Google Form. The original FastAPI backend and React frontend have been completely removed or decommissioned.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent integrated the beta signup form with a Google Form and implemented several copywriting changes requested by the user across the landing page.
- Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- Agent Testing Done: Y
- Which testing method agent to use? manual testing by screenshot tool
- User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending or in-progress issues. The last set of user requests was completed.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
- Integrate analytics (e.g., Google Analytics/Plausible) into the landing page. (P1)
- Connect a custom domain when the user is ready. (P2)

Future Tasks:
- Re-develop the full-stack application based on the features described on the landing page if the user decides to move forward from the beta phase.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Stack MVP (Decommissioned):**
  - Built a complete FastAPI, React, and MongoDB application for Social Chess Events.
  - Implemented user/club authentication, event CRUD, and filtering.
- **API Integration (Decommissioned):**
  - Integrated Chess.com and Lichess APIs to fetch and display user ratings on their profiles.
- **Branding and UI Updates:**
  - Performed multiple updates to the application's color scheme and logos based on user feedback.
- **Major Pivot to Static Site:**
  - Scrapped the entire full-stack application.
  - Initialized a new Next.js project for a static landing page.
  - Built the complete, multi-section landing page using , Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, based on detailed copy provided by the user.
- **Google Forms Integration:**
  - Reverse-engineered the user's Google Form to find the correct endpoint and field names.
  - Integrated the beta signup form on the landing page to post data directly to the Google Form.
  - Implemented all requested copy and text changes throughout the landing page.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The agent successfully addressed all issues and user requests.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- Issue recurrence in previous fork: N/A
- Recurrence count: N/A
- Status: N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Integrations:** Google Forms (via direct form submission)
- **Deployment:** Static site generation ()

**key DB schema**
N/A. The database and backend have been decommissioned.

**changes in tech stack**
- The project underwent a complete pivot from a **FastAPI + React + MongoDB** full-stack application to a **static Next.js** frontend.

**All files of reference**
- : The single most important file containing the entire landing page's structure, content, and logic.
- : Contains global styles and Tailwind CSS directives.
- : The root layout for the Next.js application.
- : Created to hold a configurable form endpoint URL, though this is now partially obsolete as the form posts directly to Google Forms.
- : Contains the history of requirements and implemented features.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  directory, containing an empty , can be safely deleted to clean up the project structure.
- In , the state and logic related to  from  are now dead code since the form submits directly to Google Forms. This can be removed to simplify the component.

**key api endpoints**
- The beta signup form posts directly to the user's Google Form endpoint: 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The most critical piece of information is that this project has undergone a complete transformation. Ignore any history related to the FastAPI backend, MongoDB, user authentication, or event management. The current and only goal is the Next.js static landing page. The backend has been intentionally decommissioned. The primary interactive feature is the beta signup form, which submits directly to an external Google Form.
